# This is the deployment repository for the website. 
- {base} needs to be infront of every navigation that routes to these pages.
- Make features/changes in other branches, if that feature/change is complete and doesn't break the website merge it into main.
- Do not break this. If the site breaks grab the original website from the officers.
- In order for this to be hosted on github pages this needs to a static website.
- There needs to be one project leader to organize and review any changes to the site. 
- A basic level of how GitHub works before writing any code. 
- The project leader should only be the one to review any changes made and they are the ones that resolve merge conflicts with the main branch. 
- Understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS 
- Officers get final say in all decisions of any major changes.  
- Keep to the color scheme 
- Make sure everyone has a GitHub account and have them set up with VSCode
