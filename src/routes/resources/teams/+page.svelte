		Wayne State College ACM communicates and stores files using Microsoft Teams. Once a member of
		ACM you will have access to use the ACM Team in Teams. Teams allows us to branch out into
		different channels so we have a conversations for said channel. Everyone has access to all of
		the main channels except for the ACM Officers and ACM Officers Tasks channels as those are only
		for ACM Officers. Channels to keep an eye on are <b
			>General, Internship Opportunities, and any of the subcommittee channels</b
		>.
	</p>
	<p class="pb-4">
		If you are joining ACM it is recommended that you download Teams on your computer or phone as a
		majority of special updates and messages will presented there. Teams also allows you to message
		people individually or in groups, which helps cut down the amount of emails being sent back and
		forth.
